//! `BlockTransform`: discriminated union of the four valid Block I/O
//! payload transforms.
//!
//! Block I/O has eight valid combinations: four `(compression,
//! encryption)` pipelines, each crossed with the optional
//! Reed-Solomon parity trailer (enabled via the `page_ecc` cargo
//! feature):
//!
//! | Variant                                          | Pipeline                                               |
//! |--------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
//! | [`BlockTransform::Plain`]                        | raw → checksum → disk                                 |
//! | [`BlockTransform::Compressed`]                   | raw → compress → checksum → disk                      |
//! | [`BlockTransform::Encrypted`]                    | raw → encrypt → checksum → disk                       |
//! | [`BlockTransform::CompressedAndEncrypted`]       | raw → compress → encrypt → checksum → disk            |
//! | `BlockTransform::PlainEcc`                       | raw → checksum → ecc parity → disk                    |
//! | `BlockTransform::CompressedEcc`                  | raw → compress → checksum → ecc parity → disk         |
//! | `BlockTransform::EncryptedEcc`                   | raw → encrypt → checksum → ecc parity → disk          |
//! | `BlockTransform::CompressedAndEncryptedEcc`      | raw → compress → encrypt → checksum → ecc parity → disk |
//!
//! The `Ecc` variants are only available when the `page_ecc` cargo
//! feature is enabled; without it, the variant list collapses to
//! the original four. ECC is orthogonal to compression / encryption:
//! parity is computed over the on-disk payload after compression
//! and after encryption, and lives in a trailer that is NOT
//! covered by AEAD authentication and NOT included in the
//! per-block XXH3 over the payload bytes. Tampering with the
//! parity trailer therefore cannot be detected by AEAD or by the
//! block checksum — it only impacts recoverability (a corrupted
//! parity trailer means the codec can't repair payload bit-flips,
//! but the payload itself is still authenticated by its own
//! checksum / AEAD tag and tampering there fails the usual way).
//! In other words: ECC is a best-effort recovery aid for bit-rot
//! in the wire bytes, NOT an integrity primitive.
//!
//! Modelling the four paths as a single enum has two concrete wins
//! over the previous "`(compression, encryption, zstd_dict)` triple"
//! argument shape:
//!
//! 1. **Invalid combinations are unreachable by construction.** The
//!    old API let `ZstdDict { dict_id }` ship without `zstd_dict:
//!    Some(_)`, which only failed at runtime as
//!    `Error::ZstdDictMismatch` deep inside `Block::write_into`.
//!    `CompressionContext`'s fields are now private; the only way
//!    to construct a `ZstdDict` context is via
//!    [`CompressionContext::with_dict`], which takes the dictionary
//!    handle directly and derives the on-disk `dict_id` from
//!    `dict.id()`. The previous "construct a ZstdDict-kind context
//!    without a dict" mistake therefore can't be expressed in the
//!    public API at all. The runtime `ZstdDictMismatch` guards
//!    inside `Block::write_into` / `from_reader` / `from_file`
//!    still execute on every block (they re-check that a dictionary
//!    is attached and that its `id()` matches the on-disk
//!    `dict_id`), but with `BlockTransform` constructed via the
//!    safe API they are defense-in-depth only and cannot fire.
//!    The one remaining path that can legitimately produce
//!    `ZstdDictMismatch` is the legacy-triple helper
//!    [`BlockTransform::from_parts`], which is checked at
//!    construction time (so the error is raised before any
//!    `Block` I/O is attempted) for callers that have not yet
//!    migrated to the typed constructors.
//! 2. **Shrinks the public surface.** `Block::write_into` /
//!    `from_reader` / `from_file` each previously took three
//!    transform-related args; they now take one
//!    `transform: &BlockTransform<'_>`.
